# Safrole Test Vectors

For details refer to ASN.1 [schema](./safrole.asn).

## NOTES

- Error codes returned as output are not part of the specification. Feel free to ignore actual values.
- On error, post-state must match pre-state.
- Ring verifier is constructed using [ark-ec-vrfs](https://github.com/davxy/ark-ec-vrfs) procedures.

## TODO

- Better specify the procedure used to construct test ring verifier.
